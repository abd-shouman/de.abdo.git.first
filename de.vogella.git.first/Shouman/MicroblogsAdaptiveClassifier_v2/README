To run the project:
	1- provide svm training window size and language in resources/classifier.config file
	2- Provide 3 proxies and 3 twitter tokens to crawel tweets from Twitter in resources/proxies.config and resources/twitterTokens.config respicetively.
	3- provide topic boolean queries to build the boolean classifier in resources/topic_queries.txt
	4- provide random queries (e.g stopwords) to crawl random tweets in resources/random_queries.txt
	5- import the project in eclipse
	6- run Program.java with JVM argument: -Djava.library.path=PATH/MicroblogsAdaptiveClassifier/svm_light_lib

Output:
- Boolean classifier dumps its output to two files (one for positive and one for negative)

	*   boolean_positive_tweets.txt
	*   boolean_negative_tweets.txt

- SVM Classifier dumps  its output to two files (one for positive and one for negative)

	*   svm_positive_tweets.txt
	*   svm_negative_tweets.txt

- output of classifiers is of the following format:
	[ID] TAB [tweet_text] TAB [time_stamp]
